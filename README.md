# Description



This is a robot I built for my electronics design lab class. It features a cruise control system, an arduino interface and a remote control.
The cruise control system utilizes a negative feedback loop created by several filters linked up to each other. The remote control utilizes a HC-05 
bluetooth module which communicates with the remote controller's arduino via UART serial communication.
